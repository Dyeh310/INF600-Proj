# INF600-Proj
 
The instructions were to choose any topic related to Internetworking and create a website. The instructor intended the website to act as a replacement for a power point presentation. I chose IP Addressing and created a few static HTML pages to display information about the topic. The grade was not for creating a modern website, but rather for demonstrating research into the topic.
