                <h3>What is a port?</h3>
                <p>
                    A port can refer to two separate things in computer networking: a physical port and a port number.
                    Although this website will not delve into a physical port, it is important to at least understand
                    what it is. A physical port refers to things such as Ethernet ports, USB ports, and Serial ports
                    (“Computer Ports”). These are used as a docking station to various cables to be inserted into the
                    computer. However, when ports are referred to in this website, we will be referring to IP addressing
                    protocols such as TCP and UDP.

                <h3>What is a protocol?</h3>
                <p>
                    A protocol, put simply, is an established rule or set of rules that dictate how data is sent and
                    received across network devices. The reason for these protocols is because of the sheer number of
                    devices and various types of information being sent across networks. Imagine if every device and
                    every piece of information was being sent under a unique set of rules. In order for such a massive
                    exchange of data to work successfully, a uniform set of rules must be established. These protocols
                    break down information and execute numerous functions across every layer of the network (“Rouse”).

                <h3>What is TCP/UDP?</h3>
                <p>
                    The acronym TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. During this protocol the device sending
                    data connects with the receiver and remains connected through the entire exchange of data. The devices
                    will remain connected until the exchange of data has been completed successfully (“Abrams”). One of
                    the major benefits of using TCP is its ability to detect errors; this is because it was originally
                    designed for the Department of Defense. In the event that a packet of data is lost while in route to
                    the receiver, TCP ensures that the packet will find another route. Another benefit is the protocol’s
                    high speed during data transfers (“Parker and Siyan”). The drawback to TCP is the high strain that
                    it places on the devices since the connection must be maintained while data is being sent and
                    received (“Abrams”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    UDP, on the other hand, stands for User Datagram Protocol. This particular protocol deals with how
                    the computer sending the data packets the information and, subsequently, releases the packets into
                    the network. Unlike TCP, UDP never directly connects with a receiver, which allows for less overhead.
                    However, there is also a greater possibility for failure because of the lack of direct communication
                    between sender and receiver. This is an excellent protocol choice for data that does not need to be
                    received during the first attempt (“Abrams”).

                <h3>How do ports work with IP Addresses?</h3>
                <p>
                    A port is just one of the many pieces that make IP addresses work. For each IP address there are 65,
                    535 TCP and another 65, 535 UDP. Anytime that a program on a computer sends or receives data, one of
                    these ports is being used. These ports are a necessary piece in the way that IP addresses are used
                    to send and receive data. Although this topic may seem a little far from IP addressing, it is
                    important to understand the moving pieces that make IP addresses so vital in networking.
