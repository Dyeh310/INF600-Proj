        <h3>What is IPv4?</h3>
        <p>
          In order to understand IPv6, an explanation of IPv4 is needed. IPv4 is a type of internet
          addressing protocol that uses a 32-bit address field to provide over 4 billion different IP addresses for
          devices
          on the internet. At the time, this limit did not case any issue; however,
          during the 1990s it became apparent that eventually there would be a problem.

        <h3>Problems with IPv4</h3>
        <div class="container">

        </div>
        <p>
          One of the major problems with IPv4 is simply there are more people online than expected.
          There are roughly 7.3 billion people in the world today and over half of them own some type of computer
          (this can include smart phones, tablets, etc). As previously mentioned, there can only be about 4.3 billion different IPv4
          address
          combinations. The number of available addresses are being used up quickly! Furthermore, this does not even
          consider individuals
          who have more than one device that requires a unique IP address. I would argue that must people in developed
          countries have at least
          some type of personal computer in addition to a smart phone.
          <br />
          <br>
          Another major issue with IPv4 is network address translation (NAT). The idea behind a
          NAT is to have a single public address that is used for many private addresses.
          This can be useful for several reasons:
          <ul>
            <li>Conserves IP addresses</li>
            <li>Allows for the privacy of device addresses</li>
            <li>Eliminates address renumbering when a network evolves.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The problem arises from a NAT overload. This can break applications and provides a security risk. ("Kirch")
          </p>
          <br />
          A third issue with the current IPv4 Internet Protocol is the two-level structure of the IP address.
          Once a network number is assigned to a network, so are all the host-number addresses for that network.
          If a network number is used, then all addresses with that network are used. This is a significant waste!
          (Stallings, 450-451)
