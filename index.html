                        <h3>Goal of this Project</h3>
                        <p>
                            The goal of this project, to put it simply, is to educate readers on IP 
                            addressing. As someone who has only dabbled in networking, 
                            I quickly came to realize just how important IP addressing is. More importantly, 
                            I realized that it crossed fields and I frequently found pieces of it when developing 
                            and designing software. For this reason, I wanted to educate myself on a topic that 
                            may seem elementary to people who study networking and data communication. 
                            My goal is not to take a deep dive, but rather get an overhead view of IP addressing, 
                            its terminology, and some of the components that accompany it. By doing this, 
                            I hope to not only gain a better foundation in the field of networking, 
                            but also give myself a new advantage when writing software. 
                            This project is for people like me who need a quick lesson in IP Addressing 101!

                <h3>IPv4</h3>
                <p>Since the dawn of the Internet, IPv4 has been used as the standard in addressing protocol. This
                    protocol
                    worked by using 32 bits
                    of data for a total of 4.3 billion unique addresses. Now with the exponential increase in devices
                    going
                    on the internet, 32 bits
                    is no longer enough. In comes IPv6 ("IPV6 Addressing").

                <h3>Network Address Translation</h3>
                <p>Understanding the workings of Network Address Translation (NAT) helps people get a better understanding of IP addressing in general.
                    NATs act as a way to mask private IP addresses behind a public address. There are various types of NATs, which use different ways to manipulate IP Addresses.
                    (â€œNetwork Address Translation").

                <h3>Routers</h3>
                <p> Most people do not have any problem identifying this device. It is not hard to see why; most of of have a router in our residence. The simple answer
                        is that these pieces of hardware give us WiFi; however, there is more to it then that. Routers come in many shapes and sizes and perform a vital role in regards to IP addresses.</p>

                <h3>Ports</h3>
                <p>
                    In a way, the very name port is intuitive. When we think of the word "port", we probably visualize a seaside town with docks and sailboats returning to 
                    <i>port</i> and heading out to sea. In networking, a port is not to far off from this idea. They are important to the topic of IP addressing since they are an 
                    essential part of the Internet Protocol ("Computer Ports").

                <h3>IPv6 Addressing</h3>
                <p> 
                    Undoubtedly, IPv6 addressing is the future regarding the Internet Protocol. The fact of the matter
                    is that the world has already exhausted its supply of IPv4 addresses and needs a solution.
                    That solution, which was created many years ago, is IPv6. Unfortunately, it is still 
                    taking some time to get off the ground.
