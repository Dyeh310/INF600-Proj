                <h3>IPv4</h3>
                <p>Since the dawn of the Internet, IPv4 has been used as the standard in addressing protocol. This
                    protocol
                    worked by using 32 bits
                    of data for a total of 4.3 billion unique addresses. Now with the exponential increase in devices
                    going
                    onto the internet, 32 bits
                    is no longer enough. In comes IPv6 ("IPV6 Addressing").

                <h3>Network Address Translation</h3>
                <p>Understanding the workings of Network Address Translation (NAT) helps people get a better understanding of IP addressing in general.
                    NATs act as a way to mask private IP addresses behind a public address. There are various types of NATs, which use different ways to manipulate IP Addresses.
                    (â€œNetwork Address Translation").

                <h3>Routers</h3>
                <p> Most people do not have any problem identifying this device. It is not hard to see why; most of of have a router in our residence. The simple answer
                        is that these pieces of hardware give us WiFi; however, there is more to it then that. Routers come in many shapes and sizes and perform a vital role in regards to IP addresses.</p>

                <h3>Ports</h3>
                <p>
                    In a way, the very name port is intuitive. When we think of the word "port", we probably visualize a seaside town with docks and sailboats returning to 
                    <i>port</i> and heading out to see. In networking, a port is not to far off from this idea. They are important to the topic of IP addressing since they are an 
                    essential part of the Internet Protocol ("Computer Ports").
