        <h3>What is a NAT?</h3>
        <p>
          The term Network Address Translation, or simply NAT, is where a device assigns a single public address to
          computers within a private network. For example, a network device such as a firewall is setup to provide a NAT
          to a computer or a group of computers. The computer goes through the firewall and is assigned this public
          address. Generally, this is used on a large network to provide a private IP address (“What is Network Address
          Translation”).

      <div class="container">
        <h3>How does it relate to IPv6?</h3>
        <p>
          With the explosion of devices logging into the internet, and the need for an IP address for each, available IP
          addresses under the IPv4 model are running out. A short-term answer to this problem can be found in NAT. As
          IPv6 begins to be implemented, NAT can provide some relief. As previously stated, a network Device creates a
          NAT for multiple computers on a network. By doing this only a single IP address is used to represent an entire
          group of computers. This drastically decreases the need for unique IP addresses within a large network. This
          is just one benefit of NAT (“Tyson”).

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Two different kinds of NATs are:</h3>
        <p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Static NAT
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In this case, an unregistered IP address is mapped top a registered IP address and can now be used
                  outside of the network (“Tyson”).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Dynamic NAT
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This type of NAT allows a user to connect to a local device with an unregistered IP address from a
                  group of registered IP address (“What is Dynamic Network Address”).
                </li>
                <li>
                  An overloading can occur when multiple unregistered IP addresses are mapped to a single IP addresses
                  by using different ports (“Tyson”).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overlapping occurs when IP addresses on the internal network are in use by another network. These must
                  be altered to create unique IP addresses (“Tyson”).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          </ul>

        <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of NAT</h3>
        <p>
          One of the advantages already discussed about NATs is the ability to help conserve IPv4 address space,
          especially when using NAT Overloading (“Cisco CCNA – NAT Advantages & Disadvantages”). Some other benefits
          are:
          <ul>
            <li>By implementing a NAT, you greatly increase the reliability of connections on the public network.</li>
            <li>The large can keep the same addressing scheme. Similarity to phone numbers and extensions, a company
              would want to provide uniformity in its IP addressing scheme.</li>
            <li>One of the biggest concerns for any network, particularly one a large one, is the chance for a security
              breech. By using a NAT, an extra layer of security exists and hosts inside the network are unable to
              reached externally (unless designate to do so).</li>
          </ul>
