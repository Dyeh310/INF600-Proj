        <h3>What is IPv6?</h3>
        <p>
          Internet Protocol Version 6, better known as IPv6, is a response to the problems of IPv4. 
          The current standard for IPv6 was created by the Internet Engineering Task Force in 1998. 
          As discussed in the section on IPv4, the exponential growth of devices connecting to 
          the internet was beginning to cause a major issue. With IPv4 only having the ability 
          to produce a little over 4 billion unique addresses, and over half of the world being 
          connected to the internet, people were outgrowing IPv4 fast (“What is IPv6?”). 
          IPv6 is undoubtedly the future of the internet.

      <div class="container">
        <h3>What are the benefits of IPv6?</h3>
        <div class="container">

        </div>
        <p>
          Although the main reason for the creation of IPv6 is to fix the shortcoming 
          in IPv4 available addresses, 
          IPv6 has other advantages as well.  Several advantages are:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              IPv6 allows for more efficient routing; it does this by allowing Internet Service Providers 
              to aggregate the prefixes of customers networking into a single prefix.  
              Furthermore, fragmentation, or the breaking of packets into even smaller fragments, 
              is now handled at the source 
              device rather than the router. To add onto this, the packets are processed even faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another improvement is that IPv6 supports multicast. This means that the data processed by 
              IPv6 will now reach only the intended host, greatly freeing up bandwidth.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the age persistent cybersecurity treats, security is always on users’ minds. 
              IPSec, which provides authentication and data integrity, is part of IPv6. 
              In the case of IPv4 firewalls would often block certain packets because of 
              the potential to carry malware; 
              this will no longer be the case thanks to IPsec being part of IPv6.
            </li>
            <p>
              These are just some of the advantages to 
              look forward to as the world (hopefully) 
              begins to shift to IPv6 (“Six Benefits of IPv6”).

        <h3>Disadvantages of IPv6</h3>
        <p>
            There are many reasons to switch to IPv6, but 
            that does not mean that it does not come with its own disadvantages. 
            Some of these include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
              IPv4 is still extremely popular and many companies and people remain steadfast in 
              their commitment to IPv4. This is increased by the fact 
              that IPv4 and IPv6 machines cannot communicate directly with each other. 
          </li>
          <li>
              It takes time to switch from IPv4 to IPv6 and the subnetting of IPv6 is difficult to read; in the end,
              people like simplicity.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Although the aforementioned reasons are legitimate, it 
            seems the main reason people do not want to switch is simply 
            because people don’t like change (“What is IPv6 Address & Why Should I Know About It?”).

      </div>


      
      <div class="container">
          <h3>Will IPv4 Disappear?</h3>
          <p>
              As of right now, no. There is no official date when IPv4 address will stop 
              being used; however, the well has run dry. As of right now, the IPv4 addresses still being 
              used are the ones being bought and sold (“What is IPv6 and Why Aren’t We There Yet?”).
