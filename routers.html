        <h3>What is a router and how does it work?</h3>
        <p>
            This is a piece of hardware that allows the devices in your home to communicate with the Internet. It is essentially a gateway between your home devices and the outside world (“Fisher”). Generally, most people see it as a port that gives you internet, but getting more technical demonstrates how it relates to IP addresses.  The router will examine a packet header’s destination IP address and then compare this to a routing table. A routing table is simply a set of rules to determine where the Internet Protocol will send data. In other words, this router will direct information where to go on a network (“Rouse”). There are a few different types of routers:

                </div>
              <li><strong>Brouter-</strong>A brouter acts as a bridge, a device that connects two or more LANs together, and a router. The idea behind a brouter is that it will route incoming data for one network and forward unrecognized data to another network (“Brouter”).</li>

                  </p>
              </div>
              <li><strong>Core Router-</strong>As the name implies, this is a massive router that acts a centerpiece for other routers on larger networks. Usually these types of routers are used for large networks and can process millions of packets every second. The cost of these devices means they are usually only employed by internet service providers (“What is a Core Router?”).</li>

              </div>
              <li><strong>•	Edge Router-</strong>This type of router acts as an entry point between two networks. The purpose of this is to increase security between internal networks and external networks. This type of router users a border gateway protocol to perform the transmission of data. Since this type of router is meant to increase network security, it comes equip with many security tools (“Network Edge Route”).</li>

          </div>
        <h3>IP Addresses and Routers</h3>
        <p>As previously mentioned, routers play an integral role in IP addressing. Routers actually have two separate IP addresses: a private and public address. As expected, a public address is what outside networks (the Internet) see when contacting the router. In this case, the IP address used has nothing to do with the router itself, bur rather the Internet Service Provider. On the other hand, routers do not disclose the private IP addresses. Furthermore, the router is able to control its private IP address as well as the IP addresses for its connected devices (laptops, desktops, phones, etc)(“IP addresses”). This works by accepting incoming data through the public IP address of the router before transmitting it to the private IP addresses (connected devices).</p>
